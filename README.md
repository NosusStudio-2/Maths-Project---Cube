# Rotating Cube 

## Description

This project is about how to develop a tool to control the orientation of 3D shapes by usinga keyboard as input. This feature is implemented in many simple 3D-design software to helpusers to visualize 3D shapes in several spatial orientations. What your tool does is to definerotations based on the user input, apply the rotation to the 3D model (rotate its frame) andfinally redraw the object refreshing the image on the screen. When this process is ran at highrates, it is possible to create the effect of interaction between the user and the 3D model.

## Key Features

 - A cube you can rotate.
 - An UI to see the cube's current rotation state.
 - You can also rotate the cube by clicking and writing in the UI.
 - You can move the camara angle.
 
## Controls

 - A,W,S,D - Rotate the cube
 - Arrows  - Move the camera angle.
